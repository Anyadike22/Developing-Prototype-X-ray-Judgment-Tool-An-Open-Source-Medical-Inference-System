# Developing-Prototype-X-ray-Judgment-Tool-An Open-Source-Medical-Inference-System.

In this project we explored the development of an interactive X-ray judgment tool that integrates advanced deep learning techniques with a user-friendly interface. 

By leveraging the power of TorchXRayVision for loading pre-trained DenseNet models and Gradio for creating an interactive user interface, we show how to process and classify chest X-ray images with minimal setup. This project  guides you through image preprocessing, model inference, and result interpretation, all designed to run seamlessly on Colab without requiring external API keys or logins. Please note that this prototype project is intended for educational purposes only and should not be used as a substitute for professional clinical diagnosis.


The model is not being fine-tuned for clinical diagnostics, so this prototype serves as a valuable starting point for experimenting with medical imaging applications. More work is needed  considering the importance of rigorous validation and adherence to medical standards for real-world use.
